# zone-test

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

## Information
I build this App in Angular CLI as this is my main tool at present, It took longer than expected due to trying to strongly type the objects.
Its a mix of ES6 and normal Javascript.

## Git repo

You will need to install Angular CLI 'npm install -g @angular/cli'

git clone https://github.com/mark-keast/zone-test.git , 

Once you clone the repo, you will need to run  'npm install'

Then run 'ng serve'

Then go to 'http://localhost:4200/'

and it should load. :relieved:


## Outstanding work.
I kept to the 2 days (evenings) and ran out of time do some tidy up and fix the Genres grouping, at present you can pick multiple Genres and see them, but at present its not filtered.
So you can get duplicate entries as they are in multiple Genre groups.
This issue was giving me a headache not working so left it for now.. think i couldn't see the forest for the trees

## Bugs
I have noticed the console shows erros regarding 'image' undefined, but F5 ad it loads okay, weird angular one, not sure issue.
