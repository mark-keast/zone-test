# zone-test

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

## Information
I build this App in Angular CLI as this is my main tool at present, It took longer than expected due to trying to strongly type the objects.
Its a mix of ES6 and normal Javascript.

## Git repo

You will need to install Angular CLI 'npm install -g @angular/cli'

git clone https://github.com/mark-keast/zone-test.git , 

Once you clone the repo, you will need to run  'npm install'

Then run 'ng serve'

Then go to 'http://localhost:4200/'

and it should load. :relieved:

## Bugs
I have noticed the console shows errors regarding 'image' undefined, but F5 ad it loads okay, weird angular one, not sure issue.


To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
