# zone-test

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

## Information
I build this App in Angular CLI as this is my main tool at present, It took longer than expected due to trying to strongly type the objects.
Its a mix of ES6 and normal Javascript.

## Git repo
Once you clone the repo, it should be a case of just running'ng serve'
I have dropped all files in so no need to install any dependencies

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Outstanding work.
I kept to the 2 days (evenings) and ran out of time do some tidy up and fix the Genres grouping, at present you can pick multiple Genres and see them, but at present its not filtered.
So you can get duplicate entries as they are in multiple Genre groups.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
